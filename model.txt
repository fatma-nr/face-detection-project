This project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based model for face recognition.

The model compares new facial encodings with a labeled dataset to identify individuals.
It is trained using encodings extracted from face images and saved as a .clf file using pickle.

- Algorithm: KNN (K = 2)
- Libraries: face_recognition, scikit-learn
- Input: Facial image -> face encoding
- Output: Predicted identity
- Requires clean and labeled training data
